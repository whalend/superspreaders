Pathogen reproduction and transmission are heterogeneous processes varying across individual hosts, communities, and landscapes that are further shaped by fluctuations of environmental conditions in space and time. Thus, advancing epidemiological theory and accurately forecasting epidemic trajectories hinge on our understanding of the influences of environmental heterogeneity on disease dynamics. Using a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, we are examining the relative and actual effects of environmental variability on disease dynamics in the Phytophthora ramorum-sudden oak death pathosystem. Our goal is to simultaneously quantify the influences of biotic and abiotic factors on disease intensity at landscape, local, and individual levels, in order to locate disease hotspots and identify potential “superspreader” individuals. We are focusing on a variegated landscape (275-km2) in Sonoma County, CA where 202 plots were established in 2004, and visited annually thereafter, to monitor the long-term disease dynamics. In each plot, we collected data on understory microclimate, disease intensity (infection level) and severity (mortality), species richness and abundance, and the diameter at breast height of all stems. We have also modeled precipitation across the study area using data from 14 monitoring stations placed throughout the region. With this longitudinal data set, we have quantified and mapped the annual disease intensity in each plot, locating hotspots of pathogen production, and developed surfaces of infection pressure across the landscape. We are now examining the direct and indirect effects of forest-stand conditions, climatic variability and landscape context, on disease intensity. By increasing our empirical understanding of how disease dynamics are governed by environmental heterogeneity in space and time we will enrich epidemiological theory and in turn be better equipped to provide more precise forecasts of epidemic trajectories.
