Some notes from meeting with Krishna on December 17, 2014. Mostly will probably end up being meaningless.

- State-space model explicitly modeling Markov process
- Process model of conditional (in)dependence
- Observational sub model
- Time trend covariate

Work up model and independence claims to share with Beth and Krishna. Provide example of at least one alternative structural model too.
