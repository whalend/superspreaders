From the package description:
>This package provides functions for defining, manipulating and fitting graphical Markov models.

For application in structural equation modeling and path analysis I am initially interested in the functionality for defining graphs. Particularly, I have a complex time-series path analysis diagramming a 1-year lag-effect.

I want to define the graph and independence claims it outlines.

library(ggm) #Load library
