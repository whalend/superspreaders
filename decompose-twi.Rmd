## Plot Contributing Area vs. Slope
This is a suggestion from Ryan to plot the contributing area vs. the slope for each of the plots in order to tease out how either influences infection and hosts. Decomposing TWI to determine which factor has a greater influence on disease dynamics.

# par(mfrow = c(3,1))

## 'facc_ws15m' is the estimate from the 'r.watershed' function in GRASS GIS

# Plot estimates from two different functions agains each other.
qplot(flowacc15m, facc_ws15m, data = plots_env) #+
      geom_text(aes(label = plotid))
cor(plots_env$flowacc15m, plots_env$facc_ws15m)
## There are 9 plots that really stand out from the others.
## The r.watershed calculation provides similar, but generally smaller values.
qplot(flowacc15m, facc_ws15m, data = filter(plots_env, flowacc15m > 300),
      main = "'High' Flow Accumulation Value Plots") +

      main = "'Low' Flow Accumulation Value Plots") +
      geom_text(aes(label = plotid))
## Much of the variability between the two estimates stems from a few plots.

# Plot flow accumulation vs. slope
qplot(slope15m, flowacc15m, data = plots_env) #+
      geom_text(aes(label = plotid))
## Can't see much pattern (if there is any) because of a few big values
      cor(plots_env$slope15m, plots_env$flowacc15m)
      ## negative, but weak

qplot(slope15m, flowacc15m, data = filter(plots_env, flowacc15m < 300), 
      main = "Flow Accumulation <300") #+
      geom_text(aes(label = plotid))
## Generally, a shallower slope means higher flow accumulation, but it's not a strong pattern
      
qplot(slope15m, flowacc15m, data = filter(plots_env, flowacc15m > 300), 
      main = "Flow Accumulation >300 ") #+
      geom_text(aes(label = plotid))
## The set of high flow accumulation plots shows an opposite general trend in the relationship between flow accumulation and slope. It's a small sample size, which leads me to consider the general trend from the large sample size being closer to the real relationship.
