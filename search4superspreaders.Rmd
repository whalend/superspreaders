## Sudden Oak Death Hosts & Environment

46 wildland host species - 5 key host tree species

## Pathogen Spillover

**“when disease epidemics are driven by transmission from an alternate reservoir host population” – Power & Mitchell (2004)**
- characteristic of multihost disease systems

## Superspreaders

Individual(s) that disproportionately contribute to disease transmission
 - potential mechanism for pathogen spillover

## Searching for superspreaders



```{r}

## Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
